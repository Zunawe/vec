Allows for the creation of vectors of arbitrary dimension that are also JavaScript Arrays. These arrays are fixed-length and accept only numbers as input, though they generally decay gracefully into regular Arrays. For example, you're allowed to use map, reduce, concat, and other Array methods, and if the result is a valid vec, a vec will be returned. Otherwise, you'll get back a standard Array with the new elements. These are specifically overloaded methods, so experimental, custom, and rebound methods aren't guaranteed to work. Install$ npm install vecnUsageSince they're the most common, vec2, vec3, and vec4 are already included: const {vec3} = require('vecn') let v = vec3(1, 2, 3) console.log(v)vec3 [ 1, 2, 3 ]If you need to create your own vector type: const vecn = require('vecn') const vec5 = vecn.getVecType(5) var v = vec5(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) console.log(v)vec5 [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]For a more in-depth description of available vector methods, see the documentation. SwizzlingSwizzling is a technique used in GLSL that allows you to access a vector's components by name and build new vectors from them. It works the same here at arbitrary length. It's easiest to see in an example: var v = vec4(1, 2, 3, 4) v.x // 1 v.y // 2 v.z // 3 v.w // 4 v.xx // vec2 [ 1, 1 ] v.zy // vec2 [ 3, 2 ] v.zywwxyyz // vec8 [ 3, 2, 4, 4, 1, 2, 2, 3 ]We can also set values with swizzling. var v = vec3(1, 2, 3) v.xz = [4, 5] console.log(v)vec3 [ 4, 2, 5 ]Swizzling only works for vec2, vec3, and vec4 (with plans to extend it with custom accessors). Important NuanceWhen creating a new vecType, you are generating a new class. However, this class is hidden behind a function that creates the object for you and returns a Proxy. Therefore, the function returned by vecn.getVecType is not a constructor. Since the new keyword implies a return this at the end of the function, but the function already returns, the existence of a new before the function call has no effect. The following code explains the importance: const vec2 = vecn.getVecType(2) var v1 = vec2(1, 2) // Valid construction var v2 = new vec2(1, 2) // Also valid, but misleading v1.constructor === vec2 // falseBasically this allows for swizzling and lets me extend Array without letting the user mess with the length. × Search results Close "},"vecn.html":{"id":"vecn.html","title":"Class: vecn","body":" vecn Classes vecn Global addgetVecTypeisVeclerpmultiplyslerp Class: vecn vecn A class for fixed-size vectors of numbers. new vecn(dimension [, args]) Creates a vecn of the specified dimension. This should never be calledby the user (as if this were an abstract class). Parameters: Name Type Argument Default Description dimension number The dimension of this vector. args Array.&lt;number&gt; &lt;optional&gt; [] The numbers to be put in the vector. Extends Array Members magnitude :number The L2 norm (Euclidian norm) of the vector. Type: number Methods approximatelyEquals(v, epsilon) Returns whether every element in each vector is approximately equal. Parameters: Name Type Default Description v Array.&lt;number&gt; A vector to test against. epsilon number 1e-8 The largest meaningful difference between twho values. Returns: True if both vectors have the same dimension and thedistance between each number is less than epsilon. Type boolean argmax() Finds the indices of the max value in this vector. Returns: An array of indices corresponding to the max values. Type Array.&lt;number&gt; argmin() Finds the indices of the min value in this vector.

Returns: The min value of this vector. Type number minus(v) Returns a vector where v is subtracted from the components of thisvector. If v is a single number, it is subtracted to each component. If vis a vector, the vectors are combined componentwise. Parameters: Name Type Description v number | Array.&lt;number&gt; The value to subtract from this vector. Returns: A new vector with the combined components. Type vecn neg() Negates each element in this vector. Returns: A new vector where all elements are negated.
