Allows for the creation of vectors of arbitrary dimension that are also JavaScript Arrays. These arrays are fixed-length and accept only numbers as input, though they generally decay gracefully into regular Arrays. For example, you're allowed to use map, reduce, concat, and other Array methods, and if the result is a valid vec, a vec will be returned. Otherwise, you'll get back a standard Array with the new elements. These are specifically overloaded methods, so experimental, custom, and rebound methods aren't guaranteed to work. Install$ npm install vecnUsageSince they're the most common, vec2, vec3, and vec4 are already included: const {vec3} = require('vecn'); let v = new vec3(1, 2, 3); console.log(v);vec3 [ 1, 2, 3 ]If you need to create your own vector type: const vecn = require('vecn'); const vec5 = vecn.newVecType(5); var v = new vec5(1, 2, 3, 4, 5); console.log(v);vec5 [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]SwizzlingSwizzling is a technique used in GLSL that allows you to access a vector's components by name and build new vectors from them. It works the same here at arbitrary length. It's easiest to see in an example: var v = new vec4(1, 2, 3, 4); v.x // 1 v.y // 2 v.z // 3 v.w // 4 v.xx // vec2 [ 1, 1 ] v.zy // vec2 [ 3, 2 ] v.zywwxyyz // vec8 [ 3, 2, 4, 4, 1, 2, 2, 3 ]Swizzling only works for vec2, vec3, and vec4. Important NuanceWhen creating a new vecType, you are generating a new class. This class, however, is hidden behind a function that creates the object for you and returns a Proxy. Therefore, the function returned by vecn.newVecType is not a constructor. Since the new keyword implies a return this at the end of the function, but the function already returns, the existence of a new before the function call has no effect. The following code explains the importance: const vec2 = vecn.newVecType(2); var v1 = new vec2(1, 2); // Valid construction var v2 = vec2(1, 2); // Also valid v1.constructor === vec2; // False Basically this allows for swizzling and lets me extend Array without letting the user mess with the length. × Search results Close "},"vecn.html":{"id":"vecn.html","title":"Class: vecn","body":" vecn Classes vecn Global isVecnewVecType Class: vecn vecn A class for fixed-size vectors of numbers. new vecn(dimension [, args]) Creates a vecn of the specified dimension. This should never be calledby the user (as if this were an abstract class). Parameters: Name Type Argument Default Description dimension number The dimension of this vector. args Array.&lt;number&gt; &lt;optional&gt; [] The numbers to be put in the vector. Extends Array Members magnitude The L2 norm (Euclidian norm) of the vector. Methods argmax() Finds the indices of the max value in this vector. Returns: An array of indices corresponding to the max values. Type Array.&lt;number&gt; argmin() Finds the indices of the min value in this vector. Returns: An array of indices corresponding to the min values. Type Array.&lt;number&gt; choose(indices) Creates a new vector from the provided indices of this one. Basicallyequivalent to swizzling. Parameters: Name Type Description indices Array.&lt;number&gt; The indices to select into a new vector. Returns: A new vector from the provided indices. Type vecn concat() Same as Array.prototype.concat, but always returns an Array. div(v) Returns a vector where this is divided by v componentwise. If v isa single number, the vector is scaled by 1/v. Parameters: Name Type Description v number | vecn | Array.&lt;number&gt; The value to multiply with. Returns: A new vector with the divided components. Type vecn dot(v) Dot product of two vectors. Parameters: Name Type Description v vecn | Array.&lt;number&gt; The vector to dot with this one. Returns: The dot product between this and v. Type number filter() Same as Array.prototype.filter, but always returns an Array. map() Same as Array.prototype.concat, but if the result does not contain onlynumbers, returns an Array instead. max() Returns the max value of this vector. Returns: The max value of this vector. Type number min() Returns the min value of this vector. Returns: The min value of this vector. Type number minus(v) Returns a vector where v is subtracted from the components of thisvector. If v is a single number, it is subtracted to each component. If vis a vector, the vectors are combined componentwise. Parameters: Name Type Description v number | vecn | Array.&lt;number&gt; The value to subtract from this vector. Returns: A new vector with the combined components. Type vecn neg() Negates each element in this vector. Returns: A new vector where all elements are negated. Type vecn normalize() Scales this vector to a magnitude of 1. Returns: A new vector with scaled components. Type vecn plus(v) Returns a vector where v is added to the components of this vector. If vis a single number, it is added to each component. If v is a vector, thevectors are added componentwise. Parameters: Name Type Description v number | vecn | Array.&lt;number&gt; The value to add to this vector. Returns: A new vector with the summed components. Type vecn pnorm(p) Evaluates the p-norm (or lp-norm) of this vector. Parameters: Name Type Description p number The p-value to evaluate. Returns: The norm of this vector. Type number pow(p) Returns a vector where each component of this was raised to a power p. Parameters: Name Type Description p number The power to raise each component by. Returns: A new vector with the exponentiated components. Type vecn slice() Same as Array.prototype.slice, but always returns an Array. splice() Same as Array.prototype.splice, but always returns an Array. sum() Sums the components of this vector. Returns: The sum of the components of this vector. Type number times(v) Returns a vector where v and this are multiplied componentwise. If v isa single number, the vector is scaled by v. Parameters: Name Type Description v number | vecn | Array.&lt;number&gt; The value to multiply with. Returns: A new vector with the multiplied components. Type vecn toArray() Converts this vector into an Array. × Search results Close "}}
